# Voldemort's Children source files

These are most of the source files for my Harry Potter fanfic webcomic, [Voldemort's Children](https://www.elidupree.com/voldemorts-children). They are rendered into the final comic by scripts from [my website source repo](https://github.com/elidupree/eliduprees-website-source), which also contains the annotations and transcripts.

Needless to say, anything in this repository may contain spoilers! At the time of this writing, this includes spoilers beyond the end of the comic that has been published so far.

## Technical details

I made these in GIMP 2.6. Their text elements don't display correctly in GIMP 2.8, so I'm stuck editing them with 2.6.

In addition to the page source files, there are a few old sketches, and the harry_potter_notes text file, which contains a bunch of the notes I used to design the story prior to the drawing it.
